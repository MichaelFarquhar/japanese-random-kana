# Japanese Random Kana

> [!NOTE]
> The project has recently been migrated from [Create React App, NPM and Sass] -> [Vite, PNPM and Tailwind]

[Live Demo on Netlify](https://japanese-random-kana.netlify.app/)

A web app that will randomly generate Japanese hiragana, katakana, and romaji to be used as a quiz for Japanese language learning. Simply click the screen to generate a new character and click again to see the answer.

For hiragana and katakana, when you click the screen a second time, it will show the romaji for the given character. If you choose to show romaji first, it will instead show both kana on the second click.
